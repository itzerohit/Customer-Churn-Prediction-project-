# Customer-Churn-Prediction-project-
:  🔹 End-to-End ML Project: Customer Churn Prediction Built, trained, and deployed ML models with 88%+ accuracy; deployed as a Streamlit web app.
# 📉 Customer Churn Prediction - ML Project with Streamlit App

Welcome to the **Customer Churn Prediction** project!  
This project uses **machine learning** to predict whether a customer is likely to leave (churn) based on historical data.  
Built and deployed using **Python**, **Scikit-learn**, and **Streamlit** for a real-time interactive web experience.

## 📌 Project Overview

Customer churn is a critical metric for any subscription-based or service-based business.  
By accurately predicting churn, companies can proactively take steps to retain customers.

In this project, we:
- Preprocess the data
- Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Train multiple ML models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, Decision Tree)
- Evaluate model performance
- Build a Streamlit web app for real-time prediction

## 🧠 Machine Learning Models Used

- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest Classifier
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Decision Tree Classifier
- GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning

---

## 🗂️ Dataset Information

The dataset contains various customer-related features like:
- Gender
- Tenure
- MonthlyCharges
- TotalCharges
- InternetService
- Contract Type
- And more...

📁 File: `CustomerChurnPrediction.csv`  
🎯 Target column: `Churn` (Yes/No)

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn (for visualization)
- Streamlit (for web deployment)
- Pickle (to save ML models)
